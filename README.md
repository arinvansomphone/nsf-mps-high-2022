Working with UCLA professors Dr. Hua Zhou and Dr. Jin Zhou, as well as Tomoki Okuno, this project features all of my progress in learning to code with R and applying it 
to biostatistical applications.

The data we worked with is from the ACCORD study dataset, which contains variables such as hba1c, 1,5 AG, blood pressure, and other cardiovascular measurements. We 
summarized and plotted the central variables of the study and used correlation methods to find predictors to abnormal cardiovascular measurments. The latter weeks of the 
internship detail our findings.
